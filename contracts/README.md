# Features
## 1. Proportional Ownership and Revenue Sharing
Token holders will receive revenue shares proportional to their holdings.
Revenue streams may include profits generated from the funded assets and operations.

## 3. Voting Rights
Token holders may participate in DAO governance by voting on proposals.
Governance could include decisions on:
Fund allocation.
Operational strategies.
Expansion plans.
(Optional: Enable voting rights based on the DAOâ€™s roadmap.)

## 4. Transferability
Tokens are transferable and can be traded or sold on supported platforms.
Ensures liquidity and flexibility for investors.

## 5. Staking Rewards
Optional: To incentivize long-term holding, staking rewards may be introduced.
Rewards could include additional tokens, exclusive privileges, or revenue bonuses.

## 6. Token Standards
We are considering two token standards to support the desired use cases:

ERC-20: For simple, fungible tokens representing governance and ownership.
ERC-1155: For mixed-use cases, combining fungible tokens (investor tokens) with non-fungible tokens (reward NFTs or asset-backed NFTs).
