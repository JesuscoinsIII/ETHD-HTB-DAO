I’m excited to present a unique opportunity to fund an innovative project at the intersection of blockchain technology, transportation, and real-world asset utilization. We’re seeking to secure $250,000 to acquire a new Executive Sprinter vehicle, enabling us to establish a scalable business model combining exclusive parking rights and luxury transportation at major sports stadiums.

The Crypto Equivalent of a Holding Company
To align with the decentralized ethos of blockchain, we propose structuring this project using a smart contract-based DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The DAO will hold 100% equity ownership of the vehicle title and parking rights, providing transparency, immutability, and community governance over the asset. Investors and stakeholders will be issued governance tokens, granting them proportional voting power and revenue-sharing rights tied to the vehicle’s operations.

The Business Model
This concept mirrors the operational model of MillionAir FBO, which manages and charters private aircraft. However, our focus is on providing exclusive parking and high-end transportation services, leveraging partnerships with local operators who maintain $5M-$10M commercial insurance policies.

Revenue Strategy: Focus on high-yield event days (e.g., NFL, MLB, FIFA, etc.) to maximize utilization and revenue.
Scalability: Revenue generated from the first vehicle will finance additional vehicles and parking rights, creating a flywheel effect for growth.
Parking Innovation: Offer exclusive parking within 50 feet of stadium entrances—a premium service that enhances the event experience.
Funding Mechanism and Loan Repayment
We aim to fund the $250K loan through community support. Here’s how it works:

Collateral: The vehicle title and parking rights are secured by the DAO (holding entity).
Revenue Allocation: $1,000 per booking is allocated toward repaying the loan, with 10% interest.
Title Transfer: Once the loan is repaid, the vehicle and rights are transferred to ModalHub, Corp., unlocking new funding for scaling the model to additional markets.
Funds will flow seamlessly through Stripe Connect, leveraging ACH direct deposits and smart contract integrations for transparency.

Why This Matters for EthDenver
This initiative isn’t just about transportation; it’s about building a decentralized physical-digital network for optimizing vehicle utilization, parking management, and community-driven growth. With the ETHDenver community’s support, we can pioneer a model that combines real-world assets with crypto innovation, proving that decentralized finance can create tangible, scalable solutions.

How You Can Get Involved
Funding: Back the project via a governance token purchase, enabling DAO ownership of the vehicle and rights.
Collaboration: Share insights, provide feedback, or partner to expand the model to additional stadiums and venues.
Innovation: Help refine the integration of smart contracts, payment systems, and decentralized governance.
